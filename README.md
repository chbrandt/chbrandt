### Hi there

Welcome to my stock of code repositories. Most of the repositories in here were used for projects in the past, that I keep for the records.
Some repositories are good stuff, that I (still) use evey now and then, for data analysis or administrative (sysadmin) tasks.

You will notice most of the repositories are in Python -- especially the ones doing data analysis/management.
Some web-stuff in JavaScript, sys-admin content is mostly in Bash.
And many apps/services are packaged as Docker containers.

As a matter of fact,
